2. [Computational Biology Reseacrh Projects](https://github.com/marjose2/Martinez_Porfolio/tree/main/Research%20Project)

Each project has their own variety of Porjects and should be accompanied by some from of documentation

# Background
Hello!
My name is Jose Martinez and welcome to my Project Portfolio! A little about me. I did my undergraduate at Lycoming College where I majored in Biology with an emphasis on Anatomy and Physiology. In my undergraduate studies, I was conducting an independent research project, the project intended to make and utilized custom in-house Perl scripts to extract data from edited videos of Drosophila. This data was used to make box plots and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to understand how the CASK gene affects the Drosophila grooming behavior.

Now I am pursuing an M.S. in Data Science with an emphasis in Bioinformatics, and I also focus on programming for whatever problems come my way and analyzing topics that interest me!
