# Background
Hello!
My name is Jose Martinez and wecome to my Project Portfolio! A little about me. I did my undergraduate at Lycoming College where I majored in Biology with an emphsis on Anatomy and Physiology. In my my undergradute studies I was conducting an independent research project, the intentions of the project was to make and utilized custom in-house Perl scripts to extract data from edited videos of Drosophila. This data was used to make box plots and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to understand how CASK gene affects the Drosophila grooming behavior.

Now I am pursuing an M.S. in Data Science with an emphasis in Bioinformatics, and I also focus on programming for whatever problems come my way and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
