In my undergraduate research project I spent most of my time 

I did my reserach under the supervistoin og Dr. David Andrew at Lycoming College.

#### Abstract: 
> Repetitive behaviors, such as grooming, are commonly linked to human neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X syndrome (FSX) (Oakes A. et al., 2016).   Drosophila melanogaster has been previously used in studies to learn about neurodevelopmental disorders. Drosophila CASK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase) lines display repetitive behavior such as consistently elevated grooming, despite their dramatic decrease in walking (Xingjie R. et al., 2013).  Drosophila CASK presents a loss of function (LOF) of the CASK gene, meaning they do not make the CASK protein, leading to increased grooming phenotype (Xingjie R. et al., 2013). Repetitive behavior, such as excessive grooming, is a crucial subject for researching disorders like FXS. By studying Drosophila CASK lines, neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, such as FXS, can be better understood (Oakes A. et al., 2016). In this study, the creation of knockout stocks, using the Elav>Cas9, Mef2>Cas9, gRNA CASK, and gRNA QUAS, will be used to study the relationship between the CASK gene and the nervous system. These stocks were created by crossing the Cas9/Gal4 lines, Elav>Cas9 and Mef2>Cas9, with either gRNA CASK or gRNA QUAS.  If the CASK gene is working in the nervous system, then knocking out the expression of these genes in all neurons during all phases of development will re-create the phenotype that we see in true null mutants. The Elav knockout stock and the control lines showed no statistical difference in the Grooming Index (GI), the number of grooming bouts, or the mean grooming bout length. The P-values for these parameters are 0.0859, 0.0469, and 0.7399, respectively. These numbers indicate that this experiment's results did not support the hypothesis that the CASK gene is working in the nervous system. In contrast, the Mef2>Cas9 x QUAS cross resulted in a recessive lethal cross.

> This Figure shows the Box plots of the values of number of grooming index values of the Elav>Cas9 x CASK and Elav>Cas9 x QUAS represented using Box-and-whisker plots. The blue box shows the 25th-75th percentiles; the red line in the box shows the median. The black lines, extending form the blue box, with the whiskers represent the 9th and the 91th. (p-value=0.0859). This box plot was constructed with 17 Elav>Cas9 x CASK (11 females and 6 males) and 24 Elav>Cas9 x QUAS (12 females and 12 males).
